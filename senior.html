 <p class = "workPara">The objective of this assignment was to create a program for storing and buying movie tickets from a database.  I made this project using JavaFX mySQL and Scene Builder.  Learning how to use SQL in my java program was new.  This assignment also introduces me to having multiple pages in the same scene in scene builder. This project also introduced tables in scene builder. The two important things that we did with tables were searching through their contents and selecting an item from the table.</p>
      <p class = "workPara">To complete this assignment I broke it down into steps.  The first step I took was making the sign in/login page.  To do this I store “users” and their passwords in a sql database.  I then accessed the database to check if the user input matched an existing user.  Then I worked on the add movie page.  The table gets populated from an sql table that stores all of the already existing movies.  I then made it so that the user could add movies to the database and add a picture for the movie.  I then worked on the edit screening page.  This table is populated with the same movies database.  On  the page the user can update the movie's availability through a choice box.  Then I made the purchase page. This table is populated from the same database as the other two however I limited it to the movies that had their “available” variable set to available.  I then make a function that gets the price of the purchase based on the amount and types of the tickets and then adds the purchase to a table in sql.

<p class = "workPara">The objective of this assignment was to create a board game and track my progress.  Throughout this assignment, I used a Trello board to set and track the tasks I planned to complete.  Until this project, I had exclusively done game design in Unity so this was the first time I used JavaFX to make a game.  My Trello board is meant to reflect every step I have taken including every time I restarted.  The trello board also reflects future plans with the project.

</p>

  <p class = "workPara">In the game the hardest part was coding the movement of the pieces.  I had restarted this part many time.  I kept changing the object that stored the position of the piece.  Originally only the tile held an image of the piece but I then realized that each piece has unique movement rules and as such each piece needed to be able to move independently from the tile.  The tile also needs to know if a piece is on it so that it can block multiple pieces from being on the same tile.  I solved this problem by making both the tile and the piece as an object.  Then after the pieces were created they were placed based on the positions of the cell.  The cells also have a variable for the piece stored in them but no longer have their own image of the piece on them.
</p>

        <p class = "workPara"> After I figured out the movement the rest of the project became easier.  I then made a turn based system.  I did this by storing whose turn it is in a static variable.  I added highlights and animations to the game.  Highlights and animations were new things that I learned.  I had to use a timeline to make the animation and a setEffect to make the highlights.  </p>
