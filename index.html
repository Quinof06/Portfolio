        <p>As a student of Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School's computer science technical program, I am looking for opportunities to develop my skills in my trade further. Over my time in class, I have learned web design, java programming, JavaFx, cyber security, and game design.   My goal for my immediate future is to explore various areas of computer science at either UMASS Dartmouth or Bridgewater State University. This will help me attain my long-term goal of working in computer science.

</p>
        <p>Throughout high school it has been important to me to be involved in my school community.  I have taken on many leadership responsibilities including Senior Class Vice President, Junior Class Secretary, and shop representative. Holding these leadership positions has taught me public speaking and effective listening skills.   Additionally, I have been involved in several clubs and student organizations such as; student council, student advisory board, NHS, and SkillsUSA. Being a part of various organizations has allowed me to appreciate productive collaboration.  
</p>
        <p>Outside of school I have also developed many critical skills.  As a member of  the Middleborough High School - Old Colony co-op wrestling team I have developed my teamwork skills and time management. I have also spent time as a babysitter, allowing me to learn communication, patience, and interpersonal skills.
</p>
        <p>I believe in volunteering in my community.  As part of the National Honor Society, I have volunteered at many events over the course of my high school career.  I have also volunteered for the OC PTO on more than one occasion.  Of note I worked with a team of fellow computer science students to build a website for the Old Colony PTO.  My role on this team was the Scrum master and as such I was the direct line between the PTO and the students. In addition to completing an individual page,  I also helped with the HTML and CSS on multiple pages.</p>
       
        <p>Over the past four years at Old Colony RVTHS I have obtained the qualities to help me succeed in the computer science field.</p>
